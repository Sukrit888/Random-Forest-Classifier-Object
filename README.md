# 🌲 Random Forest Classifier Project

This project implements a **Random Forest Classifier** to solve a supervised machine learning problem using Python. The objective is to train a model that can predict class labels based on a dataset using an ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy and robustness.

## 📌 Project Summary

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier (Ensemble Learning)
- **Platform**: Google colab
- **Goal**: Predict the output class from the given dataset based on input features.
- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Read CSV data using `pandas`
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Basic statistics
   - Correlation matrix
   - Pairplots and boxplots for feature relationships
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables (if any)
   - Splitting into training and test datasets
4. **Model Building**
   - Using `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`
   - Hyperparameter tuning
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report
   - Feature importance analysis

## 📊 Results

- The Random Forest model provided **high classification accuracy**.
- **Feature Importance** revealed which attributes were most significant for predictions.
- Evaluation metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score** validated the model's performance.
